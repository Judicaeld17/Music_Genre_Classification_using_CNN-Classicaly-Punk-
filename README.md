## Task
Most of music streaming platforme uses Machine Learning to improve their solutions and perform better customer retention.
To achieve thier goals, this platformes also use ML for music recommandation. 

The first step of developing a music recommandation system is to start by classifing musics by genre. 
In this project we will devellop a powerful music genre classification model that will be able to identify 
the genre of a music with a couple of genres.

The big challenge here is to make our model understand a music and find pattern in each music in order to
differentiate if from other ones.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
Their is a lot of algorithm and methods to perform music genre classification according to papers
we read. 

According to this papers, CNN model seems to be one of the most performant model at this task. 
Then, for our project we decide to use a CNN model.

In fact , CNN model are very good classifing images and since we are working with audio file
we find a way to convert our audio file to spectograms (images) and then pass them to our model.

## Installation
Librosa
Tensorflow-io
Tensorflow
Streamlite

## Usage
The user just need to run the note book.
To use the model already deplyod the user can the link to the prediction interface powered using Streamlite
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
